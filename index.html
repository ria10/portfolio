    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Ria, a recent Mathematics graduate from King's College London. Currently I am a Trainee Full Stack Developer at futureproof. </p>
    <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
    <p>Originally I already knew I wanted to go into the Technology field as I'd been exposed to it since childhood, but my interest in coding began when I had to study it for one of my modules at University. The summer before the academic year I completed the Python course on Codeacademy and from then I knew that coding was something that I really enjoyed. From there I had the opportunity to join futureproof's coding bootcamp and I am really excited to learn more about developing!</p>
